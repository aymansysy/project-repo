<p><strong>The Adoration of the Magi:</strong><br>The three kings worship the baby Jesus on the central panel. The donors, their children and patron saints appear on the wings: the father with his six sons and<br>Saint Jerome (left), and the mother with her seven daughters and Saint Catherine (right). The two children in white shrouds had died. On the outer wings are <br>Saint Christopher and Saint Anthony Abbot.</p>
<p><strong>The Crucifixion: </strong> <br> For his depiction of Golgotha, the mountain on which Christ was crucified, the artist chose a high viewpoint. In doing so, he created a vast landscape in which <br>to represent successive episodes of the Passion of Christ simultaneously. This narrative convention was often used in medieval painting.
</p>
<p><strong>Saul and the Witch of Endor</strong> <br>Fearing the outcome of a battle, Saul, king of the Israelites, consulted the fortune-telling witch of Endor. On hearing that he would lose, the king threw himself<br> on his sword. His suicide – in the middle background – is a warning against witchcraft. In the foreground is a Witches’ Sabbath: the fortune-teller sits <br>within a chalk circle, surrounded by other witches, satyrs and imaginary figures.</p>

<p><strong>The Fall of Man</strong><br>In the left background we see God (a cloud with a human face and hands) cautioning Adam and Eve. They may eat the fruit of all of the trees, except the tree of <br>'the knowledge of good and evil'. Tempted by the serpent (with a human torso), Adam and Eve nevertheless eat the forbidden fruit, for which they were driven <br>from Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>Bathsheba at her Toilet</strong><br> The beautiful Bathsheba bathes out of doors assisted by two maidservants. King David spies the young woman from the roof of his palace and instantly falls in love. <br>Although he is not depicted in the painting, David’s presence is suggested by the castle in the distance. Curiously, the servant seen from behind has a male body.</p>
<p><strong>The Massacre of the Innocents</strong><br>When Herod, the King of Judea, learned that a child destined to become 'King of the Jews' would be born in Bethlehem, he ordered the slaughter of all boys under the <br>age of two. The painter portrayed the massacre as a gruesome nightmare. Horror follows upon horror: at lower left a soldier slits a child's throat, while above them a <br>woman gouges out a soldier's eyes.</p>

<p><strong>The Jewish Bride</strong><br>To prevent being killed and having his wife captured by King Abimelech, Isaac concealed his love for Rebecca by pretending they were brother and sister.<br> However, their intimacy betrayed them when they thought they were not being spied on.<br>  Rembrandt depicts them in a tender moment. Furthermore, he works with exceptional freedom, applies the paint thickly, and scratches into it with the butt end of his paintbrush.</p>
